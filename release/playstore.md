> The world is becoming increasingly urbanised and this is leading to an increased lack of interest in wildlife and a reduction in the time people spend outdoors in greenspaces.

There are still some major known issuse that are in the application that we wish to fix as soon as possible.
### Key Issues
* Welsh language settings doesn't apply to the species identifier
* Minor bugs when trying to log in with facebook
* Share feature linked to social media to share the species identified

### Apsirations

In order to fully complete the aim of the product the app will have to inclued:

* Inclusion of a map function for locating and recording species
* Connectivity with other users
* A search feature for known species without having to use the identification feature every time
* Ability to use sound to help in the identification
